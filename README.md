# LinuxScripts
Scripts I've put together to make life easier (for me).

I've given these the UnLicense because I hope these help you, whomever you are, at some point. I know I've been helped and learned from what I've foundonline and I'd like to pay it forward. Plus this is a way for me to keep my stuff documented as I learn and tech changes.

An explanation of scripts:

Update.sh -- Updates any Linux system that uses apt-get.
